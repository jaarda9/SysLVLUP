# PWA Icons

This directory contains the icon files for the PWA:

- `icon-72x72.png` (72x72 pixels)
- `icon-96x96.png` (96x96 pixels)
- `icon-128x128.png` (128x128 pixels)
- `icon-144x144.png` (144x144 pixels)
- `icon-152x152.png` (152x152 pixels)

- `icon-384x384.png` (384x384 pixels)
- `icon-512x512.png` (512x512 pixels)

These icons are referenced in the manifest.json file and are required for proper PWA installation on devices.

**Note:** The current files are placeholders. For a production app, replace them with actual PNG images.

To create these icons:
1. Design a simple icon that represents your app (at least 512x512 pixels)
2. Export it in PNG format at all required resolutions
3. Replace the placeholder files in this directory
