## Testing PWA Installation

### **Android Edge/Chrome:**
1. Open your app in Edge/Chrome
2. Look for the **"Install"** button in the address bar (three dots menu)
3. Or look for a banner saying "Add to Home Screen"
4. Tap "Install" or "Add"

### **Android Samsung Internet:**
1. Open your app
2. Tap the menu (three dots)
3. Look for "Add page to" or "Install app"
4. Follow the prompts

### **iOS Safari:**
1. Open your app in Safari
2. Tap the share button (square with arrow)
3. Scroll down and tap "Add to Home Screen"
4. Tap "Add"

### **Desktop Chrome:**
1. Open your app in Chrome
2. Look for the install icon in the address bar
3. Click it and follow the prompts

## Troubleshooting

### **If "Install" button doesn't appear:**

1. **Check HTTPS**: Ensure your site is served over HTTPS
2. **Check Manifest**: Visit `https://your-domain.vercel.app/manifest.json`
3. **Check Service Worker**: Open DevTools → Application → Service Workers
4. **Check Console**: Look for any errors in the browser console

### **Common Issues:**

- **"No manifest found"**: Check if `/manifest.json` is accessible
- **"No service worker"**: Check if `/sw.js` is accessible
- **"Icons missing"**: Ensure all icon files exist in `/icons/` folder

## Testing Checklist
