# PWA Setup Instructions

## Icon Requirements

For a proper PWA installation experience, you need to replace the placeholder icons with actual PNG images. Here's what you need to do:

1. Create a high-quality icon for your app (at least 512x512 pixels)
2. Generate the following sizes from your base icon:
   - 72x72.png
   - 96x96.png
   - 128x128.png
   - 144x144.png
   - 152x152.png
   - 192x192.png
   - 384x384.png
   - 512x512.png

3. Replace the placeholder files in the `icons` directory with your actual PNG files

## Testing PWA Installation

To test if your PWA is installable:

1. Serve your application over HTTPS (or localhost for development)
2. Open Chrome DevTools and go to the Application tab
3. Check the Manifest section to verify all icons are loading
4. Check the Service Workers section to verify the service worker is registered
5. Look for the "Installability" section which will show any issues

## PWA Requirements Checklist

- [x] Valid manifest.json file
- [x] Service worker registered
- [x] App icons in multiple sizes
- [x] Proper metadata in HTML
- [ ] HTTPS in production (required for installation)
- [ ] Offline functionality (handled by service worker)

## Additional Notes

For iOS Safari, the `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` meta tag enables the "Add to Home Screen" functionality. The additional icon sizes help ensure proper display on various Apple devices.

For Android, the manifest.json file and service worker are the key components for installation through the browser.
