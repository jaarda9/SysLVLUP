# PWA Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the PWA:

- `icon-192x192.png` (192x192 pixels)
- `icon-512x512.png` (512x512 pixels)

These icons are referenced in the manifest.json file and are required for proper PWA installation on devices.

To create these icons:
1. Design a simple icon that represents your app
2. Export it in PNG format at both 192x192 and 512x512 resolutions
3. Place the files in this directory with the exact names mentioned above
