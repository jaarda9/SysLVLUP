# User Manager Test Plan

## Testing the Centralized User Management System

### Test 1: User ID Consistency
1. Open the application in a browser
2. Check console logs for user ID creation/retrieval
3. Navigate to different pages (status, alarm, quests)
4. Verify the same user ID is used across all pages
5. Check MongoDB to ensure no duplicate user entries

### Test 2: Data Synchronization
1. Make changes to game data on one page
2. Navigate to another page
3. Verify data is consistent across pages
4. Check that sync operations use the same user ID

### Test 3: Browser Session Persistence
1. Close and reopen the browser
2. Verify the same user ID is retrieved
3. Check that user data is preserved

### Test 4: Error Handling
1. Simulate network errors during sync
2. Verify the application continues to function with local data
3. Check that errors are properly logged

### Expected Results:
- Single user ID per browser instance
- No duplicate MongoDB entries
- Consistent data across all application pages
- Proper error handling and logging
- Seamless user experience across page transitions

### Verification Commands:
Check browser console for:
- "Existing user ID found:" (should appear on subsequent page loads)
- "Sync successful using centralized user manager"
- No "New user ID created:" messages after initial creation

Check MongoDB for:
- Single document per user ID
- Consistent data across sync operations
