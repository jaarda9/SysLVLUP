# Data Synchronization Fixes for PWA

## Issues Fixed

1. **Proper User Identification**: Previously, the user ID was hardcoded as 'your-user-id'. Now, the system generates a unique user ID and stores it in localStorage for persistence across sessions.

2. **Consistent Data Sync**: All data synchronization components now use the same user identification method, ensuring data consistency across the app.

3. **PWA Standalone Mode Support**: The fixes ensure that data synchronization works properly when the app is installed as a PWA on iOS or Android devices.

## How It Works

1. **User ID Generation**: When the app first runs, it generates a unique user ID in the format `user_[timestamp]_[random_string]` and stores it in localStorage.

2. **Data Loading**: When the app starts, it loads user data from MongoDB using the stored user ID.

3. **Data Saving**: When the app is closed or when explicitly called, it saves all localStorage data to MongoDB with the same user ID.

4. **Cross-Device Consistency**: Since the user ID is stored in localStorage, when the PWA is installed on a device, it will maintain the same user ID and access the same data.

## Testing the Fix

1. Install the PWA on your iOS device
2. Use the app and create some data
3. Close the app completely
4. Reopen the app - your data should still be there
5. Check MongoDB to verify the data was saved correctly

## Important Notes

- The user ID is stored in localStorage, so if a user clears their browser data, a new user ID will be generated
- For production use, you might want to implement a more sophisticated user identification system with proper authentication
- Data is automatically synced when the page is unloaded, but you can also manually trigger sync operations
